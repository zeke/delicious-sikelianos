His amazing, unprecedented collection of animals, plants and insects from all around the world gained international fame during his lifetime. In 1731, after decades of collecting, Seba commissioned illustrations of each and every specimen and arranged the publication of a four-volume catalog detailing his entire collection—from strange and exotic plants to snakes, frogs, crocodiles, shellfish, corals, insects, butterflies and more, as well as fantastic beasts, such as a hydra and a dragon." hash="805b0db9e947fe842e952400af20a568" href="http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/classics/all/04802/facts.albertus_seba_cabinet_of_natural_curiosities.htm" private="no" shared="yes" tag="to_buy book art illustration" time="2008-11-20T17:38:37Z"/><post description="TASCHEN Books: Atlas of Anatomy" extended="We owe a great debt to Jean Marc Bourgery (1797–1849) for his Atlas of Anatomy, which was not only a massive event in medical history, but also remains one of the most comprehensive and beautifully illustrated anatomical treatises ever published in any language.
